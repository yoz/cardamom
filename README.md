cardamom
========

A cross-platform (web platform) offline (appcache) simple viewer for dance cards.

I created it to solve a variety of problems at once:
- My primary card store is text files on my computer. These are easy to edit and view, but not convenient to work with when actually calling. They could be lost if I lose my computer.
- My secondary card store was physical index cards. These are easy to annotate and handy for calling, but they're cumbersome to produce and difficult to adapt for gender-free calling. They could also be easily lost.

The Cardamom platform, thus far, only provides a viewing interface, so it doesn't have the editability of the other formats yet. Its coolest feature is the "gender" toggle.
